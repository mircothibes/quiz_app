# Status — 2026-01-15

## What happened
- UI structure got inconsistent (root `ui_*.py` vs package `ui/`).
- Multiple refactors/merges introduced conflicts and a broken login flow in some states.

## Current decision
- Stop restructuring today to avoid further regressions.
- Tomorrow: rebuild the project structure cleanly and standardize UI imports.

## Known issues to fix next
- Pick ONE UI source of truth (either `ui/` package OR root `ui_*.py`) and remove the other.
- Ensure login signal payload matches `on_login_success` signature.
- Restore icons/assets paths consistently for PyInstaller.
